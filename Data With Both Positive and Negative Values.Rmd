This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
2.1. Data With Both Positive and Negative Values

2.2. Grouped Bar Charts
A grouped bar chart can be used to show two measurements, e.g. two times.

This visualization would be more effective for

- a smaller number of categories
- with more variation in rations within and between categories.

In this case the dot plot is a much better choice.

2.3. Stacked Bar Charts

A stacked bar chart is appropriate when adding the values within a category to form a total makes sense


The combined bars show the totals.
The bar segments show the contribution of each year within the sites.
Comparing 1931 yields across sites is easy; comparing 1932 values is harder.
A stacked bar chart would make no sense for the two-year life expectancy data.


Category Order

Ordering of categories can change the visual effectiveness of bar charts.

Faceting
Faceting can be used with dot plot and bar charts as well:


:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r, fig.height= 8.0, fig.width=8}
ggplot(df, aes(x = country, y = diff, label = country)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = type), width = 0.5, alpha = 0.8)  +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), 
                     labels = scales::dollar) +
  scale_fill_manual(labels = c("Above median", "Below median"),
                    values = c("Above" = "purple", "Below" = "blue")) + 
  labs(title =  "GDP per capita, 2007",
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       fill = NULL) + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())
```
