## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
2.4. Heat Maps

Heat maps encode a numeric variable as the color of a tile placed at a particular position in a grid.
Heat maps are also called matrix charts or image plots.

Heat maps can be effective in cases where a line plot contains too much over-potting, such as


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder)
```
```{r}
gapminder
```



A heat map of these data:

```{r, fig.height= 7.5, fig.width=10}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>% 
  ggplot () +
  geom_tile(aes(x = year, y = reorder(country, lifeExp), fill = lifeExp)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high="blue") +  # to provide extreme colors of the palette
  ylab(NULL)
```
